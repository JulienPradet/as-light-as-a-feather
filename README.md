# WCCChallenge - Wave

My entry for @sableraph's WCCChallenge

This week's topic was "wave". Went a bit far away :)

But try to imagine something that's horizontal. No, not like that. Yep, more like that.

Some early results in this thread: https://twitter.com/JulienPradet/status/1520317886098817024

## Installation

Then run the following commands:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

And you should be able to open a new tab at http://localhost:3000 where you'll see the results.

Click on the result to load a new one.
