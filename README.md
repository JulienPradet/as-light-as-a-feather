# canvas-jp-starter

Starter kit to bootstrap a new [canvas-jp](https://github.com/JulienPradet/canvas-jp) project.

## Installation

This remote is to be cloned next to [canvas-jp](https://github.com/JulienPradet/canvas-jp)'s clone. If you're not putting these in the same folder, `package.json` should be changed to use the correct path for `canvas-jp` dependency.

Then run the following commands:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

And you should be able to open a new tab at http://localhost:3000 where you can develop your brand new [canvas-jp](https://github.com/JulienPradet/canvas-jp) project.
